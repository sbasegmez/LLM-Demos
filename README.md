# Large Language Models - Demo Project

This repository supports my sessions on large language models and their integration into Domino apps. You can find the slides for the sessions below:

- [Experimenting with Integrating Large Language Models into Domino Apps" at Engage 2024.](https://speakerdeck.com/sbasegmez/engage-2024-experimenting-with-integrating-large-language-models-into-domino-apps)
- Integrating Large Language Models into Domino Applications: A Primer at OpenNTF Webinars [TBD]

Please note that some of the code requires the project metadata database and langchain4j integration from OpenNTF, which are going to be publicly available soon.

### Repository Modules

- TBD

### Compatibility

#### Java

This project requires Java 17 or higher.

#### Apple Silicon

If youâ€™re running Apple Silicon computers, use a x86_64 JVM (e.g. IBM Semeru OpenSDK 17) to run the demo databases.
